## Overview

In this challenge, I built an entire app illustration from scratch.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik&display=swap)


### What I learned

This are some of the css codes I was happy to have practiced on on this project


```css
.header-content{
    margin-top: 5px;
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    background-color: transparent;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    align-items: center;
    
}
```
### Continued development

I want to build more on my flexbox and css-grid scills.


### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp - This helped me understand and implement flexbox. I really like how it breaks down the topic and provide examples for each section.

- https://css-tricks.com/exploring-the-complexities-of-width-and-height-in-css/ - This is a must read article
for anyone trying to master css. This helped me sharpen my knowledge on how height and width of an element can be manipulated for a desired outcome.
